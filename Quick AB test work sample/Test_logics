Metric Selection:
Conversion rate is chosen as the primary metric for this A/B test. This measures the proportion of visitors who make a purchase.

Randomization Units:
Each visitor is randomly assigned to either the control or test group.

Target Population:
The visitors to the e-commerce site are the test population, ensuring bots or non-human traffic are excluded.

Sample Size Calculation:
Using statsmodels’ power analysis, we compute the sample size needed to detect the expected effect, accounting for the effect size, significance level (α), and power (1 - β).

Test Duration:
With daily traffic and required sample size, we estimate the test duration.

Statistical Testing:
We apply a Z-test for statistical significance, calculating the Z-statistic and P-value to determine whether the observed difference between the groups is significant.

Visualization:
A bar chart visualizes the conversion rate for both control and test groups.

Alternatives to A/B Testing:
If A/B testing is impractical, alternatives include:

Multi-Armed Bandit: Optimize tests in real-time.
Quasi-Experiments: Use observational data.
Simulations: Model different potential outcomes without running a live test.
